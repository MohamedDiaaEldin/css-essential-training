Selctor 
    the most basic type of selector is html elements     
      to select every html element we can use * 
        example : apply css to all h1 elements in the page                 
            h1 here is the selector
            h1{

            }
            or more than html element
                h1, h2 {
                    color : red ;
                }
            
class and id selectors :
- class and id naming conventions 
    - don't use spaces 
    - use underscore or dash
    - use meaningfull name

- class selector :
    - class selector can be resued throw the document 
    - we can use more than class in the smae html element
    - example 
        .class_name{
            font-style : italic ;
        }
    - to combine more than class in the css 
        in html element define two class with space betweeen them -> class="first_class second_class"
        .first-class_name.second_class_name{
            color : red ; 
        }
    - to apply style to class and html element 
        p.class_name {
            color : red ; 
        }
- ID selector:  
    - are not resuable - it's only used once for page 
    - example 
        #id_name{
            font-style: italic ;
        }
    - can be used to link to spot on the page using href
        example 
            <a href="#id_name">link to other element in the page</a>
            <section id="id_name"> line goes here </sections>

nested selctors :
    let's say we have html 
        <section>
            <p>paragraph</p>
        </section>

    - Inheritance : all section tag style will be applied to the children elements too 
        but not all html element follow this concept 
    - to style the paragraph tag 
        sections p {
            color : red ;
        }
    
    we can use the same concept with id and class nested element 
    it will be somthing like 
        style h2 which is inside what every the container with class name   
        .class_name h2{
            color : red ;
        }

    - Specificity : 
        - look for online calculater
        - rand from lowest to hright 
            - universal     (*) 
            - type          (p)
                - nested type   (section p)
            - class         (.)
            - id            (#)
        
        - to override all of this we can use !important key word
            p{
                color : red!important ;
            }
